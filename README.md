# Assignment1/  
**CSC2042S 2025 - Assignment 1: Unsupervised Learning**  
**This assignment is primarily for doing PCA and K-means** 
**In this assignment:**  
**I used PCA as part of the data pre-processing as an attempt to improve cluster performance**

# Assignment2/  
**CSC2042S 2025 – Assignment 2:**  
**Implementing a Milticlass-Perceptron for the Simpson images for GRAYSCALE images and RGB images**  
**To see if color improves the classifiers accuracy and other performance metrics such as F1,recall and precision**  

# Assignment 3/  
**CSC2042S 2025 – Assignment 3:**    
**Logistic Regression: for English and IsiXhosa**  
**To train and evaluate separate models for two languages: English and isiXhosa**  
**Each language covers a different subset of news categories in the  MasakhaNEWS dataset**  
**This does mean that one language might have some imbalance or poor data quality which may harm performance**    
**The aim is to experiment with hyperparameters and modelling decisions**   
**To see if we can improve performance**  

# Assignment 4/   
**CSC2042S 2025 – Assignment 4:**  
**A neural network to process and train using backpropagation**   
**The aim is to experimentally discover how hyperparameters impact performance**   
**The list of hyperparameters one can choose to vary  includes : learning rate ,optimizers, activation functions , number of neurons in the hidden layer one etc.**  
**Dataset can be foud at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist**
